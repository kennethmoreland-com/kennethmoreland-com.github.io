# Kenneth Moreland

Welcome to my home page, where you will find a list of my current and past
activities. I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory for the [Visualization group] in the [Computer Science and Mathematics
Division]. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of New
Mexico in 2004. My work has been primarily focused on research and development
with large-scale visualization.

This page contains posts of most of my professional technical work. Use the menu
to view my projects, research, and publications. I also occasionally make [blog
posts] that are less formal but usually technically relevant.
