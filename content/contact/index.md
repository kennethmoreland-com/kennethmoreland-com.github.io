## Visiting

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory campus is located in a secured area with
gaurded, restricted access. Before visiting ORNL, your trip must be prearranged
for you to access the lab.

Once your visit is arranged, you will enter the lab from the East or West gate.
(It is best to have your own car. Taxis and rideshares may have trouble getting
through the gate.) These gates are on either end of Bethel Valley Road, which
passes through the whole laboratory. At your arrival, you will first have to
report to the [ORNL badge office], which is near the roundabout on Bethel Valley
Road. Although there is a small parking lot near the badge office, I recommend
parking in the larger lot to the North (uphill) of the roundabout and then walk
down, across Bethel Valley Road to the South to the first building on your left.
If I have not met you there, my office is nearby in building 5700, room G207.

More information about visiting and maps are available at the [ORNL contact pages].
