## Abstract

The most common abstraction used by visualization libraries and applications
today is what is known as the visualization pipeline. The visualization pipeline
provides a mechanism to encapsulate algorithms and then couple them together in
a variety of ways. The visualization pipeline has been in existence for over
twenty years, and over this time many variations and improvements have been
proposed. This paper provides a literature review of the most prevalent features
of visualization pipelines and some of the most recent research directions.
