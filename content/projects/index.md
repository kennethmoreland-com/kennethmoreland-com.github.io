## Current Projects

{{< project name="Viskores" link="https://github.com/Viskores/viskores" icon="viskores.png" >}}
I am one of the lead developers for Viskores, a toolkit of scientific
visualization algorithms for emerging processor architectures. Viskores supports
the fine-grained concurrency for data analysis and visualization algorithms
required to drive extreme scale computing by providing abstract models for data
and execution that can be applied to a variety of algorithms across many
different processor architectures.

{{< project name="RAPIDS2" link="https://rapids.lbl.gov/" icon="rapids.jpg" >}}
I am a member of the RAPIDS2 SciDAC Institute for Computer Science, Data, and
Artificial Intelligence. My role in RAPIDS2 is to work with DOE Office of
Science application teams in addressing visualization challenges for science
discovery.

{{< project name="ParaView" link="http://paraview.org/" icon="paraview.png" >}}
I am an active member in ParaView development. ParaView is a general-purpose
scientific visualization tool. ParaView is designed to analyze extremely large
data sets using distributed memory computing resources. It can be run on
supercomputers to analyze data sets at extreme scale as well as on laptops for
smaller data. Our recent work involves running ParaView in situ with simulation.

{{< project name="IceT" link="http://icet.sandia.gov/" icon="icet.png" >}}
I developed the IceT parallel rendering library and continue to maintain it. In
addition to providing accelerated rendering for a standard display, IceT
provides the unique ability to generate images for tiled displays.

{{< project name="VisLies" link="http://www.vislies.org/" icon="vislies.png" >}}
I am one of the organizers of the VisLies event commonly held in conjunction
with the IEEE Vis conference. VisLies is an irreverent but informative event
where we present (and often ridicule) examples of visual representations that
misrepresent the underlying phenomena.

{{< project name="UseLATEX.cmake" link="https://gitlab.kitware.com/kmorel/UseLATEX" >}}
I created several LaTeX file build scripts called UseLATEX.cmake for use with
CMake to build my dissertation. I continue to maintain and use these scripts.

## Past Projects

{{< project name="VTK-m" link="https://m.vtk.org" icon="vtkm.png" >}}
(2014--2025) I was the lead for the VTK-m project, which was the predecessor to
Viskores. The name was changed to join the High Performance Software Foundation
(HPSF).

{{< project name="XVis" link="http://xvis.org/" icon="xvis.png" >}}
(2014–2017) I was the lead PI for the XVis project, which brings together the
key elements of research to enable scientific discovery at extreme scale.
Components for modeling, simulation, analysis, and visualization must work
together in a computational ecosystem, rather than working independently as they
have in the past. This project provides the necessary research and
infrastructure for scientific discovery in this new computational ecosystem by
addressing four interlocking challenges: emerging processor technology, in situ
integration, usability, and proxy analysis.

{{< project name="SDAV" link="http://sdav-scidac.org/" icon="sdav.png" >}}
(2013–2017) I was a co-PI for the SciDAC Scalable Data Management, Analysis, and
Visualization Institute (or SDAV for short). The SDAV mission is to actively
work with application teams to assist them in achieving breakthrough science and
will provide technical solutions in the data management, analysis, and
visualization regimes that are broadly applicable in the computational science
community.

{{< project name="Dax" link="http://daxtoolkit.org/" icon="dax.png" >}}
DaxDax(2010–2014) I was leading the Dax project for next-generation
visualization tools. Dax provides a framework for designing visualization
algorithms with massive amounts of concurrency. The first iteration of this
project is focusing on GPU accelerators with a transition plan for supporting
future architectures. The Dax software was one of the precursors to VTK-m and
Viskores.

{{< project name="UltraVis" link="http://ultravis.org/" icon="ultravis.png" >}}
I was a co-PI for the SciDAC Institute for Ultrascale Visualization (or UltraVis
for short). The UltraVis mission is to address the petascale visualization
challenges facing computational science and engineering.
